## About Me

My name is [**Henry Sippel**](https://github.com/sipphen). I just graduated from high school in May and plan on attending University of Utah in the fall. I enjoy skiing, sailing and listening to music in my free time.

## About the Project
My project, *Looking at Fish Stocking data in Lake Michigan* aims to look at the different fish stocked in Lake Michigan, and the trends of the population of fish stocked. I sourced my data from an excel spreadsheet, which I then downloaded through RStudio and then made my graph and website. 

## Goals
* Visualize the number of fish stocked into the lake over time
* Look at the change in fish stocking throughout different species
* Determine if there is a connection between fish stocking and years passed
